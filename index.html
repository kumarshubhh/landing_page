            <h3>Introduction of AI</h3><br>
            
            <p></p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems of performing tasks that require human intelligence. AI aids, in processing amounts of data identifying patterns and making decisions based on the collected information. This can be achieved through techniques like Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Robotics. AI encompasses a range of abilities including learning, reasoning, perception, problem solving, data analysis and language comprehension. The ultimate goal of AI is to create machines that can emulate capabilities and carry out diverse tasks, with enhanced efficiency and precision. The field of AI holds potential to revolutionize aspects of our daily lives.</p><br>

            <h3>Importance of AI</h3><br>
            <p>Today, the amount of data in the world is so humongous that humans fall short of absorbing, interpreting, and making decisions of the entire data. This complex decision-making requires higher cognitive skills than human beings. This is why we’re trying to build machines better than us, in these task. Another major characteristic that AI machines possess but we don’t is repetitive learning. Let consider an example of how Artificial Intelligence is important to us. Data that is fed into the machines could be real-life incidents. How people interact, behave and react ? etc. So, in other words, machines learn to think like humans, by observing and learning from humans. That’s precisely what is called Machine Learning which is a subfield of AI.  Humans are observed to find repetitive tasks highly boring. Accuracy is another factor in which we humans lack. </p>

            <h3>Future of AI</h3><br>
            <p>The future of AI is likely to involve continued advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, which will enable AI systems to become increasingly capable and integrated into a wide range of applications and industries. Some potential areas of growth for AI include healthcare, finance, transportation, and customer service. Additionally, there may be increasing use of AI in more sensitive areas such as decision making in criminal justice, hiring and education, which will raise ethical and societal implications that need to be addressed. It is also expected that there will be more research and development in areas such as explainable AI, trustworthy AI and AI safety to ensure that AI systems are transparent, reliable and safe to use.</p>
